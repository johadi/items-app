Simple Items App

## How it works
There are 5 items from which you can select any, and the links (in a button form) will enable/disable based on certain conditions outlined below:

- LINK 1 : Enabled when Item 1 is checked
- LINK 2: Enabled when Item 3 & 5 are checked
- LINK 3: Enabled when all items are checked
- LINK 4: Enabled when no items are checked
- LINK 5: Enabled when all odd items are checked
- LINK 6: Enabled when all even items are checked
- LINK 7: Enabled when at least one item is checked
